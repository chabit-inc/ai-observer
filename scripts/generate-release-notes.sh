# Create prompt for Claude
PROMPT="You are generating release notes for AI Observer $TAG, an OpenTelemetry-compatible observability backend for AI coding tools (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI).

Analyze the ACTUAL CODE CHANGES below to understand what was implemented, not just the commit messages. Write a detailed, user-friendly summary that explains the value of these changes.

## Commit Messages (for context only)
$COMMITS

## Files Changed (summary)
$DIFF

## Code Diff (analyze this carefully)
$DIFF_FULL

---

Generate release notes in markdown format with these sections (only include sections that have relevant content):

## Highlights
A compelling 2-3 sentence summary of the most important changes. Explain WHY these changes matter to users.

## New Features
Detailed descriptions of new functionality. For each feature:
- What it does
- How users can use it (brief usage example if applicable)

## Improvements
Enhancements to existing functionality. Explain what's better now.

## Bug Fixes
What was broken and how it was fixed. Be specific about the issue.

## Technical Changes
Notable internal changes that advanced users might care about (API changes, performance improvements, dependency updates).

Rules:
- Analyze the actual code diff to understand what changed - don't just rephrase commit messages
- Be specific and detailed - mention actual function names, endpoints, or features affected
- Explain the user benefit of each change
- Skip trivial changes (formatting, minor typos, CI config tweaks)
- Use clear, professional language
- Output ONLY the markdown, no preamble or explanation"
